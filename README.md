# walletifai-demo
A demo login page using react native 


# Getting started

### Express Server
You can find the basic NodeJS server in the /server directory. You can run `node index.js` to boot up a local express server to serve a basic response for the login endpoint.


### Running the react native app

In the `walletifai-demo` directory, run `npm run web` to open the developer menu as well as a preview of the app in the browser. You can run the app on iOS (tested on iPhone 11 simulator) using the menu options which will install the expo on the simulator and run the app in debug mode. 

### Screenshots 
You can find screenshots of the app in `/screenshots`
